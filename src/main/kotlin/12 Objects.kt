/*
* Objects:
 The Object keyword in Kotlin lets you define a type that only has a single instance, a named object.
 A type defined with object cannot have constructors.
*
* Objects can have properties and member functions
*
* Why might you want to use an object?
* The object keyword lets you easily implement the singleton pattern.*/
